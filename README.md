# .io
_Linux Dotfiles for my profile and aliases._ - I'm keeping this here because it's so cute and naiive how this idea got started.

I'll release the Full Description when its a little closer to reality.  

Don't ask for a Gentu/suse/REL etc branch, there are too many branches, the point of this is to have crossover functions which allow dynamic OSes.  
These will remap based on what neofetch says your distro is.  
_That's just not set up yet. Soon-coming!_

## Unimerge  
_The moment I've all been waiting for_

Let's face it, at this point I don't have any real followers yet, so no one has awaited this merger, except me. However, it is __a pretty big deal__.  
Moving forward it will just be "how .io works" but .io used to be in different branches for different distros and it was getting a lot to maintain and too busy, and it still barely did anything!

now it uses direnv and detects your OS and plugs the right verbs!
